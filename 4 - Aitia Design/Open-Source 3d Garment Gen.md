| Name | Input Modality | Output Type | Pattern-Friendly | Open Source | Notes on Usage | Link |
|------|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|------|
| **ChatGarment** | Text + Image | Sewing patterns (JSON) + 3D garment | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes | Best current system for *pattern-first* workflows. Generates structured garment specs that can be converted into sewing patterns and simulated. Research code; requires setup and cleanup. | https://chatgarment.github.io/ |
| **GarmentDiffusion** | Text + Image + Partial Pattern | Sewing pattern graphs / edges | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes | Diffusion-based pattern generation. Strong if you want vector-like pattern components rather than meshes. Less turnkey than ChatGarment. | https://github.com/Shenfu-Research/Garment-Diffusion |
| **Dress-1-to-3** | Single Image | 3D garment + sewing patterns + physics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Partial | One of the strongest image-to-pattern pipelines. Produces simulation-ready garments. Code availability is limited/partial; more research than toolchain. | https://dress-1-to-3.github.io/ |
| **WordRobe** | Text | Textured 3D garment mesh | ⭐⭐⭐ | Partial | Best text-to-3D mesh generator for garments. Meshes need retopology and panel extraction before sewing. Good Blender compatibility. | https://wordrobe24.github.io/WordRobe_Page/ |
| **ClotheDreamer** | Text | 3D garment geometry (Gaussian-based) | ⭐⭐ | Partial | High visual fidelity; less pattern-structured. Better for visualization than sewing unless heavily processed. | https://ggxxii.github.io/clothedreamer/ |
| **Garment3DGen** | Image | 3D garment mesh + texture | ⭐⭐⭐ | Yes | Useful for reconstructing garments from reference photos. Output needs cleanup for pattern extraction. | https://github.com/nsarafianos/Garment3DGen |
| **DressCode** | Text | Parametric garment programs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Yes | Earlier text-to-garment work focused on programmability. Less visual realism, but strong structural control. | https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16465 |
| **Tailor (Human-Tailor)** | Text | Avatar + garment geometry | ⭐⭐ | No (research preview) | Promising integrated avatar+clothing system. Not yet usable for pattern extraction. | https://human-tailor.github.io/ |
| **SimAvatar** | Text | Simulation-ready clothed avatars | ⭐⭐ | No | Focuses on physically plausible clothed humans rather than separable garments or patterns. | https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2025-06_simavatar |
