# Feedback (Eavesdropping?)

The rough idea for this story is that there is some means of hearing what people say behind your back, and how different people react.

  

1. hear good things -> happy

2. hear gossip -> start stirring things up

3. hear nothing -> sad

4. hear secrets -> confront someone.

  

This is no more than a kernel of an idea.

  

# Inklings

## The High-School Reunion

- Someone hears people from deep in their past talking about them. They are different know and recognize the pain they caused but feel so distant from it now.

- Someone hears close friends talking about them and has their insecurities confirmed.

    - perhaps bad friends and this motivates them to leave

    - perhaps good friends and this motivates them to change

- Maybe the group of friends who hear the feedback were all part of a radio club in High School.

    - Maybe they're at an airbnb together for their 20 year reunion.

    - They're airbnb-ing their radio teacher's house. He was an eccentric man, but he always made them feel welcome. They had thought maybe he was a little lonely.

        - Tragedy of Mr. Eaves was that he never met someone, and died alone.

    - Find his equipment in the basement. Find shelf of notebooks with names.

        - Maybe this is because they want to do a memorial show for him.

- They hear what people are saying about them at the reunion. This motivates their interactions at the reunion.

- There will have to be separate arcs for each character. For a short story, maybe keep the group small. I'm thinking 4, where each act of the story can focus on one character.

## The Dinner Party

- A bunch of friends are at a dinner party. We follow one friend. They are pulled aside by their friend, who looks a little unwell and taken to a little closet. There's a little desk and earphones and a small chair.

- Their friend asks them to tell them what they hear. They don't hear anything. They're friend is distraught. They're taken out of the closet and watch the host pull someone else into the closet.

- About ten minutes later, that person comes out of the closet, walks up to their significant other and asks if they can speak outside.

- The host goes and perches on the couch. pretending not to listen.

- Main person grabs the host's significant other and pulls them into the closet. They ask what this is?

    - other host looks embarassed, says husband has become obsessed. Probably just feedback or a stray signal. He swears its real.

    - main person listens again, nothing

    - interrupted, someone else comes in, curious about what's going on. Starts listening and eyes light up.

    - You hear something? Yes. What? I'm not sure. You both go back to the party, I'm just curious and bored enough to listen for a bit.

## Research Station (or Research Ship)

- Arctic Station

- Space Station

- Research Ship

- A bunch of scientists together on a ship or station. Each one begins hearing different things.

- The person who hears nothing has made their life their work. They weren't mean, no backstabbing, but they spent all of their time doing what they ought to do. They have an external locus of control.

- The feedback can cause

    - Fights on the ship

    - Homesickness

    - Loneliness

    - Love (hearing someone talk about wanting you that you didn't know about)

## The Nursing Home

- An elderly woman in a nursing home discovers she can hear what her adult children say about her when they think she can't hear (due to dementia/hearing loss).

- She's been pretending to be more confused than she actually is to avoid difficult conversations and get more attention.

- Through the "feedback," she learns:

    - Her son talks about the burden of visiting but comes anyway out of love

    - Her daughter discusses selling the family home but struggles with guilt

    - The staff genuinely care about her, discussing her favorite foods and comfort

    - Her grandchildren ask their parents when "Grandma will be herself again"

- The revelation forces her to choose: continue the charade of confusion for easier relationships, or engage authentically with the time she has left.

- Explores themes of aging, family dynamics, dignity, and the masks we wear even in vulnerability.

- The "device" could be an old radio in her room that picks up conversations from the hallway, or hearing aid that malfunctions in a useful way.

## The Night Shift Security Guard

- A security guard at an office building hears what employees say about them during late-night overtime sessions.

## The Trucker

- A trucker hears what people say about them on their Radio

- Old Radio was broken, have someone at a truck stop offer to install a new one

  

# Notes

- This is a compelling idea, because we tend to be more honest about people when they are not around. That doesn't mean we always speak ill of absent people, but we are more likely to criticize people--even people we love and admire--when they are not around. This story is gripping because most of us have wished we could hear what people say about us when we are not around.

- Of the inklings above, I think that the High-School Reunion is the best concept. It lends itself naturally to the idea of change over time. What do people who knew me 20 years ago think about who I was?
