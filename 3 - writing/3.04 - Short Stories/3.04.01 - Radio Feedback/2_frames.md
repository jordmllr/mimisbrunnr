# Dinner
## Tuck arrives at the school
Tuck is borderline late to the reunion. He pulls his big rig into the parking lot. He combs his hair and straightens his shirt in the rearview mirror. He tells his dog, Hank, to keep an eye on things. Hank looks up at him without lifting his head. Good boy. He pops out of the truck, cowboy boots clicking on the pavement. Oli is waiting for him. She says the others are inside. She figured he'd show up. link arms and walk in together.

## Dinner
- The gymnasium was decorated with a wizard of Oz theme: 'There's no place like home.' 
- Oli drops Tuck off at the table. I have to go in the back to check on something. 
- "Don't you know Oli's little catering business is the one doing the food tonight?"

## Drive back to the House
- Oli rides back to the house with Tuck. Hank remembers her. 
- Tuck asks about the family and the business. Oli's wife is home with the kids tonight. 

## Drinks
Adrian offers them both a fancy cocktail. Tuck declines and asks if there's any beer. Oli says she put his favorite in the fridge. Tuck throws her a smile and goes into the kitchen. Notices a door to the basement that says 'Ryan Reeves: Private'. He walks back into the living room and drops into an armchair and cracks the beer.

"Oli, is this Mr. Reeves' old house?"
Oli blushes. 
"I thought it was fitting. We bought it and fixed it up into a rental a few years back."
"What happened to Mr. Reeves?" Mel asked.



- The Radio Room - Tucker says they should go see if the radio stuff is still in the basement. They find the notebooks and dust off and plug in the radio stuff.


- Oli's station - Wife tucking kids in. saying nice things about Oli. cuts to other conversation about Oli, saying that the food was good but simple. Shame she never got out of this town, she could have done great things. 
- Adrian's station - Adrian wants to hear his station next. It's someone saying that he will be a footnote. The producer of the purple couch. Cuts down Adrian's inflated ego. Adrian storms off to bed. Mel follows him.

- Tuck walks Oli home. She asks Tuck if he thinks the person on the radio was right, if she's wasting herself in this town. Tuck says he's been all over: big cities, overseas, small towns. Seen people at their best and their worst. People are people everywhere. On a 20 million dollar yacht or bum-fuck kansas, people are people. They want friends, family, food, fucking, financial stability and a house to put all those things in. You've got all four so I reckon you're doing alright.

- What about you? I make out fine on the road. No, don't you get lonely on the road? No friends? I've got you, don't I? You only come through once a year if that. I worry about you sometimes out there. You don't need to worry Oli. I'm fine. I'm just fine.

- Tucker walks home. He'd always been cut different. people did need the F's, but not all people. folks like Tuck--he'd met a handful of others--just didn't need those things in the same way. Floaters he called them. He was a floater. He walks around the whole town. Catching glimpses of the night through windows. Letting Hank sniff this and that. He was a floater, and that was alright with him.

- Gets back to the house and notices lights still on in the basement. He goes to turn them out, but finds Mel there hunched over the radio equipment. She has a 10,000 ft stare. Tuck touches her shoulder and she jumps. "Jesus, Tuck. You almost killed me." "Hear anything good?" "Nope.
Tuck pulls out a pack of cigarettes. "For special occasions. Care to join me?" Mel looks back at the radio. There's still some voices from the earphones. "C'mon Mel, it's a nice night outside."

- They sit on the porch steps of the house, smoking their cigarettes. Mel asks Tuck if he ever wishes he has more of an impact? Does he ever want more than just driving some cargo cross-country? Tuck drags on the cigarette and looks up at the stars. Mel confides that she doesn't know if what she and Adrian do is important. It's all just talk. They get to people who talk for a living to talk to them and they also talk for a living. It doesn't feel real. Adrian thinks they're changing the world, but it doesn't feel like it. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I just wanted to get out of here and be famous, be someone that got out, you know--be a real person. And I did, I got out; I got famous--sort of. I've been invited to exclusive events hosted by important and powerful people who knew my name. But it doesn't feel like enough anymore. I see Oli and I get jealous. I don't know why. I don't want to make pies for a living. I never could cook. But people here know her, like her, depend on her. It may just be food, but it's real. It's not just talk. She matters to the people here.
