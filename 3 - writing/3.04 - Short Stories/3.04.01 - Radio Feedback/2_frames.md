- Tuck arrives at the school

    - Tuck is borderline late to the reunion. He pulls his big rig into the parking lot. He combs his hair and straightens his shirt in the rearview mirror. He tells his dog, Hank, to keep an eye on things. Hank looks up at him without lifting his head. Good boy. He pops out of the truck, cowboy boots clicking on the pavement.

    - Oli is waiting for him. She says the others are inside. She figured he'd show up. link arms and walk in together.

    - The gymnasium was decorated with a wizard of Oz theme: 'There's no place like home.' Oli's company did the catering. Local prairie foods.

- Reunion Dinner - The radio club friends reunite. They catch up a little, and Tucker notes how he doesn't remember Adrian being such a douchebag. 

- Return to the house - The friends return to the airbnb. Oli suggests a night cap. They get to talking about Mr. Eaves. Oli tells the story she knows. They all remark how sad it is. Adrian talks about the loneliness epidemic

- The Radio Room - Tucker says they should go see if the radio stuff is still in the basement. They find the notebooks and dust off and plug in the radio stuff.

- Oli's station
- Adrian's station
- Mel's station

- Mel leaves the radio room

    - Mel hears something on her station that upsets her

    - Adrian says she's just tired

    - Trucker asks when he became such a dick

        - at this point Adrian has been condescending and pretentious all night. Tucker is sick of it.

    - Adrian fires back

- Mel and Tucker have a cigarette on the front porch

    - Tucker offers a cigarette to Mel.

        - We'll probably be the last generation of smokers. Good riddance. I shouldn't be doing this.

            - Contrast Tuck's recognition of the good, Mel's guilt. If you're gonna smoke, Mel, just enjoy the smoke.

    - remember when Mr. Eaves caught us smoking behind the radio room.

    - Mel confides that she is tired. She's tired of all of it. Feels stuck, like she can't quite catch her breath. Feels like she just talks to the same people about the same things. That's why it hurt to hear what the people said on the radio
