# Dinner
## Tuck arrives at the school
Tuck is borderline late to the reunion. He pulls his big rig into the parking lot. He combs his hair and straightens his shirt in the rearview mirror. He tells his dog, Hank, to keep an eye on things. Hank looks up at him without lifting his head. Good boy. He pops out of the truck, cowboy boots clicking on the pavement. Oli is waiting for him. She says the others are inside. She figured he'd show up. link arms and walk in together.

## Dinner
- The gymnasium was decorated with a wizard of Oz theme: 'There's no place like home.' 
- Oli drops Tuck off at the table. I have to go in the back to check on something. 
- "Don't you know Oli's little catering business is the one doing the food tonight?"

## Drive back to the House
- Oli rides back to the house with Tuck. Hank remembers her. 
- Tuck asks about the family and the business. Oli's wife is home with the kids tonight. 

## Drinks
Adrian offers them both a fancy cocktail. Tuck declines and asks if there's any beer. Oli says she put his favorite in the fridge. Tuck throws her a smile and goes into the kitchen. Notices a door to the basement that says 'Ryan Reeves: Private'. He walks back into the living room and drops into an armchair and cracks the beer.

"Oli, is this Mr. Reeves' old house?"
Oli blushes. 
"I thought it was fitting. We bought it and fixed it up into a rental a few years back."
"What happened to Mr. Reeves?" Mel asked.


- The Radio Room - Tucker says they should go see if the radio stuff is still in the basement. They find the notebooks and dust off and plug in the radio stuff.

- Oli's station
- Adrian's station
- Mel's station

- Mel leaves the radio room

    - Mel hears something on her station that upsets her

    - Adrian says she's just tired

    - Trucker asks when he became such a dick

        - at this point Adrian has been condescending and pretentious all night. Tucker is sick of it.

    - Adrian fires back

- Mel and Tucker have a cigarette on the front porch

    - Tucker offers a cigarette to Mel.

        - We'll probably be the last generation of smokers. Good riddance. I shouldn't be doing this.

            - Contrast Tuck's recognition of the good, Mel's guilt. If you're gonna smoke, Mel, just enjoy the smoke.

    - remember when Mr. Eaves caught us smoking behind the radio room.

    - Mel confides that she is tired. She's tired of all of it. Feels stuck, like she can't quite catch her breath. Feels like she just talks to the same people about the same things. That's why it hurt to hear what the people said on the radio
