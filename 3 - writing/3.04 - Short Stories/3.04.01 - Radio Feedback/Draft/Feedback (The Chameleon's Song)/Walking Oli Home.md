Tuck walks Oli home with Hank. Asks about Oli's crazy dream. Oli blushes a bit. It would never work. Tuck shrugs and waits for her to continue.

Well, we went on this ancestry trip where we travelled to the places where our family's were from. Took the kids and everything, loved it. But it struck me that wherever we went, there is something like a dumpling. Every culture seems to have it in their cuisine, and it got me thinking: what if you had a dumpling shop that rotated through all these different dumplings, and not only that...

She stops short, but Tuck encourages her to go on. 

Well, what if you had the rotating traditional menu: 5 or 6 traditional dumplings from around the world; But what if you also had an experimental list that played around with the idea of a dumpling. like, wait here--she runs inside. 

She comes back with a little box and says it's just a prototype. Tuck opens it and inside is a caramel, spun sugar cage with a white creamy sphere in the middle: a creme broulee dumpling. He pops it in his mouth and its as incredible as you would think it would be. 

Oli says that some of what Adrien said is true. Oli has been wanting to branch out and push herself. 

Tuck asks when she opens this place? She gets shy and says its just a dream, and it probably wouldn't work in town. Tuck makes a couple observations about how Lattes and Cappuccinos used to be for cities, but now almost every tiny town has an espresso shop. You're not trying to convince people to eat frog lips, you're telling them to eat a little pocket of something delicious. 

She gives him a sharp look.

"What?"

"That's the name I was thinking of"

"What is?"

"Pocket, that's what I was going to call it."

Tucker smiles

"I wouldn't be so quick to abandon your dreams, Oli. A lot weirder things have made it in a lot more unlikely places. Put me down for a reservation for opening night."

"Will do" Oli twirls and dashes inside. Tuck wondered if she would ever stop being that little girl who always twirled and ran inside after he walked her home.

# Context
Oli had actually gone to culinary school and interned at a restaurant as a food experimenter and scientist. She came home to be with her folks as they got older, and so that their kids could know their grandparents. She started a restaurant and catering business that does local farm and ranch to table foods for normal folks. It is unpretentious, unostentatious, and delicious. 

# Alternatives
Instead of dumplings, it could be something more place based. Though how place based does something have to be?
