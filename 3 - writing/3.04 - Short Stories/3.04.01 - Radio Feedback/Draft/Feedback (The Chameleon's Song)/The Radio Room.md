They go into the radio room

each person has a turn listening to what's said about them

Oli goes first. it's all nice stuff, though a little criticism about her being a lesbian and the food.

Tuck is next. There's a long silence, and then there's a boy's voice praying for him and Hank. That's his nephew.

Then Adrien goes. He hears some discussion about his dancing, though not as much as he'd like. He worked for hours and hours on that routine, even hired a choreographer, but it gets "interesting moves"? He moves to some other people, there's a conversation about him and Annabelle. They're talking about how they were in high school. Adrien was a snobby outsider and Annabelle was an over-achiever who was going places, though also a bit of a mess. Then finally, someone mentions just how "fake" he is. Adrien curses the speaker and storms upstairs. Annabell follows him to calm him down. 

Tuck offers to walk Oli home, it'll give Hank and him some exercise.
