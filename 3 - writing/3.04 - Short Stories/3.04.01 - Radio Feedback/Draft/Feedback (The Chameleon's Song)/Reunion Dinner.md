"Where is Adrien?" Tuck asked.
"Over by the punch, stirring up gossip would be my guess. I don't know how he gets people to tell him the things they do, but he really has a knack for it."
"Always has." Tuck said.
"What are you up to these days?" asked Annabelle.
"Still hauling cargo coast to coast." said Tuck.
Annabelle's eyes widened briefly.
"Really? I always thought you end up doing something...different."
"Different how?"
"I don't know. Star debater and all that. I thought you'd end up somewhere doing some more imp--just different."
Tuck leaned back and looked around at the gymnasium. People in various combinations of dresses and suits clustered into little groups, chatting and nodding. 
"My high school self might have been disappointed in me too." Tuck said.
"Tuck, I didn't mean--" Anabelle started.
"It's alright. My high school self was a cocky shit. Maybe that's why I got along with Adrien so well back then."
"Tuck the Truck!" a voice called out behind him.

Adrien walked up to the table and set down 4 plastic cups on the table sloshing some of the golden liquid onto the white tablecloths. Oli winced.

"Tuck, I wasn't sure you'd come!" Adrien said.
Tuck smiled.
"How could I miss Gary Polk's attempt to fit into his prom suit?"
Adrien chuckled.
"I just heard some juicy things about him over by the--oh! let's have a toast first."
Adrien lifted his cup. The others followed suit.
"To the finest--and most attractive--AV club this school has ever seen!"
The plastic cups clicked against each other and Adrien drained his in a single tilt.

The punch was fragrant and sweet. There was lemon in it and something else in it. Vanilla?
"Oli, what's in this?"
 "It's a Sweetgrass Sour."
 "It's a triumph is what it is, Oli" Adrien said.
 "You don't like it, Tuck?" Oli asked.
 "It's not my usual" Tuck said.
 "Two fingers of cheap whiskey, you mean?" Oli said.
 "Exactly."
 "You might not be the only one. I've heard a few complaints about it already, but we distilled the sweetgrass liquor ourselves, so I was proud to share it. All harvested locally."
 "Your talent is wasted here, Oli."
 "Adrien--" Annabelle interrupted.
 "I'm just saying, in DC you would have a line around the block for this sort of niche place-based stuff. There's nothing more important than place."
 
# scene notes
The AV friends have dinner. Tensions emerge as Adrien is very condescending about the people at the party. Tuck confronts him with a jab, and Adrien turns on him. Then Adrien apologizes and the dinner is awkward until the music starts up. 

Adrien can be eating her food while talking about how it could be so much more. It's so simple, it's delicious, of course its delicious, but so simple and cliche: meat and vegetables. Where's all her training and invention and spark? If she could just get to a big city where people could really appreciate her talents, not stuck here. 

Oli called away to help with a small crisis in the kitchen.

- Tuck tells Adrien that his problem was never knowing when to shut up. 
- Adrien and Tuck spar til Annabelle stops it.

Oli comes back. Everything is alright in the kitchen again. Music starts up, let's go dance.

Adrien is a wild man on the floor. Tucker is a little impressed he can let loose so much. Annabelle dances in Adrien's orbit. Adrien even pulls out some wild acrobatics. (Later we'll find out that this has been rehearsed; this really peeves Tuck who thought he was seeing something interesting and unexpected in Adrien.)


# Notes and Objectives
We need to establish the other characters in this scene. How do we get to know Adrien and Annabelle in this scene?
- I think Adrien can be loitering by the punch bowl hoping to overhear some gossip
- Annabelle guesses this is what's happening, and turns out she's right -> Adrien is a gossip, Annabelle knows him well
- Introduces eavesdropping theme early
