The AV friends have dinner. Tensions emerge as Adrien is very condescending about the people at the party. Tuck confronts him with a jab, and Adrien turns on him. Then Adrien apologizes and the dinner is awkward until the music starts up. 

Adrien can be eating her food while talking about how it could be so much more. It's so simple, it's delicious, of course its delicious, but so simple and cliche: meat and vegetables. Where's all her training and invention and spark? If she could just get to a big city where people could really appreciate her talents, not stuck here. 

Adrien is a wild man on the floor. Tucker is a little impressed he can let loose so much. Annabelle dances in Adrien's orbit. Adrien even pulls out some wild acrobatics. (Later we'll find out that this has been rehearsed; this really peeves Tuck who thought he was seeing something interesting and unexpected in Adrien.)

Oli says that some of what Adrien said is true. Oli has been wanting to branch out and push herself.
