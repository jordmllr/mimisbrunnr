"Where is Adrien?" Tuck asked.
"Over by the punch, stirring up gossip would be my guess. I don't know how he gets people to tell him the things they do, but he really has a knack for it."

# scene notes
The AV friends have dinner. Tensions emerge as Adrien is very condescending about the people at the party. Tuck confronts him with a jab, and Adrien turns on him. Then Adrien apologizes and the dinner is awkward until the music starts up. 

Adrien can be eating her food while talking about how it could be so much more. It's so simple, it's delicious, of course its delicious, but so simple and cliche: meat and vegetables. Where's all her training and invention and spark? If she could just get to a big city where people could really appreciate her talents, not stuck here. 

Oli called away to help with a small crisis in the kitchen.

- Tuck tells Adrien that his problem was never knowing when to shut up. 
- Adrien and Tuck spar til Annabelle stops it.

Oli comes back. Everything is alright in the kitchen again. Music starts up, let's go dance.

Adrien is a wild man on the floor. Tucker is a little impressed he can let loose so much. Annabelle dances in Adrien's orbit. Adrien even pulls out some wild acrobatics. (Later we'll find out that this has been rehearsed; this really peeves Tuck who thought he was seeing something interesting and unexpected in Adrien.)


# Notes and Objectives
We need to establish the other characters in this scene. How do we get to know Adrien and Annabelle in this scene?
- I think Adrien can be loitering by the punch bowl hoping to overhear some gossip
- Annabelle guesses this is what's happening, and turns out she's right -> Adrien is a gossip, Annabelle knows him well
- Introduces eavesdropping theme early
