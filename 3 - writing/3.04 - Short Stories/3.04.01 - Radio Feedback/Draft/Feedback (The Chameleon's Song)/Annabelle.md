Tuck finds Annabelle hunched over the Radio which is turned way down. Tuck overhears some of the chatter. 

More voices talking about what they thought Annabelle would do and how she became impressive as everyone knew she would. Others say her show is just talking heads. Maybe this is friends Annabelle used to be very close with but lost touch. Always meant to reach out but never did and then its 10 years later.

Tuck fishes in his coat pocket and finds a box of cigarettes. He offers her one. She hesitates, he gestures again and she turns off the radio and they walk outside. 

She talks about them being right about her in high school. Most kids smoke because they think its cool. She smoked as a way to take the edge off. She did everything for everyone. Class president, Prom Queen, all of it. Now, I'm fucking tired. Slumps down onto the stoop. 

She worries tat what they do doesn't matter and she feels like she doesn't know Adrien anymore. He's so hidden under layers of performance. She still loves him, even though he's an ass. She wants him to be happy, but it's so hard to tell. He's always happy, but always pushing.

What about you? Tuck asks

Me? French inhale. I'm fine.

Tuck lets the word sit in the air

It's just. I did all that because I thought I was meant to be someone, to do something, to make a difference. When we started, it felt like we were. We were getting people who hated each other to sit down and have a fucking civil conversation. Now, I don't know...it is just talking heads. Talking about nothing for an hour feels more rewarding when nothing isn't pretending to be something. Tying flies never claims to be a transformative force in people's lives. It was people talking to each other, and it didn't matter about what. They connected, shared a moment and for that moment they saw each other as people. Now, we pantomime civil discourse. one side civilly shares their talking points prepared by their handlers; then the other side does the same. It's all so civil and nice and gets awards every year for God knows why; it's all a fucking wank parade.

I forgot you were a connoisseur of curses. 

Tuck says he used to listen to her show. Asks what she wants to do...
