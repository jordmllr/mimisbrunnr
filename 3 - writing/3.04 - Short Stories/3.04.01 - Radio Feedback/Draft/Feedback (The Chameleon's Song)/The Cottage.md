The friends meet back at the cottage and Adrien is making cocktails. He is very good at food and drink. Maybe this is the one thing that he actually seems to do for himself? A socially advantageous hobby. Perhaps he was so harsh about Oli's food because he's jealous that she is doing what he loves as a profession. 

All the while he's making drinks, he tells some stories about various politicians and celebrities in Washington. He spins a good yarn. 

They all have drinks and Adrien asks Tuck what he does for all those lonely hours on the road. Tuck tells him that he listens to the radio. Adrien perks up and then deflates when he realizes Tuck doesn't listen to their show. He has a flip phone and uses the actual radio. Especially likes driving through the night, less traffic and that's when people really show themselves on the radio. 

Adrien wants to press the issue. How can Tuck listen to paranormal nonsense when the country is in the state its in? How can he stand the ramblings of bumpkins and rednecks who are crazy or traumatized or both? 

Annabelle interjects saying that Adrien married one of those bumpkins, they just moved before the flying saucer got her. 

Attention shifts to the house. They realize that it is Mr. Reeves's house
