Tuck pulled the semi past the 'Rutherford High School' sign and threaded it behind a row of cars. The parking lot was packed. Tuck gave a cursory glance as if to spy a better parking space for the rig, but, seeing none, he shrugged and muttered "I guess they'll just have to wait til I leave."

He reached behind the seat and pulled a rumpled blazer out from under his mastiff, sleeping in the bunk.
'Sorry, Hank.'
Hank sighed, circled twice and slumped back down with a long groan. 
Tuck laced his arms through the blazer and fixed his collar in the mirror. He lifted the stetson from the seat next to him and hovered it over his head. 
"what do you think, Hank? Hat or no hat?"
He glance back at hank who glanced up at him, sighed again, and looked away. 
"No hat, good call."
Tuck tossed the stetson back into the passenger seat and opened the door.
"We'll go on a long walk after. Beautiful out!" he called back to Hank as he opened the door and slipped out of the truck and into the warm Kansas air.

His boots clicked across the blacktop. Looked like it'd been poured recently. He walked toward the main lane that led to the school entrance. A small figure was standing at the edge of the sidewalk, noticed him and waved enthusiastically. He walked a little faster.

Oli was dressed in a white swing dress patterned with hand-painted lemons. Standing on the crub, she was almost his height.
"you're late." she said
"I consider it a point of pride that I was never on time when I attended this fine institution, and I wouldn't want to sully my good name by starting now."
"Adrien and Annabelle are inside already."
"Holding court?"
Oli smacked his chest.
"Be nice. It's an AV club reunion. Don't spoil it by being mean."
Tuck held up two fingers in a boy scout salute.
"promise."
"Let's go!" Oli said.
She looped her arm through his and walked him up the path towards the entrance.

Entering a school you haven't been to in a decade is a strange experience. The eerie familiarity crawled up the hair on the back of Tuck's neck. 
"Kay at home with the kids?" Tuck asked.
"She is. She asked about you. Said you were so kind when you visited that time."
"She caught me on an off day."
Oli through a sharp elbow into his stomach.
"None of that. You're kind and charming. You'll have to accept it."
Tuck opened his mouth and then closed it again. They passed the empty reception desk and headed down the hallway towards the gymnasium. The faint pulse of music grew louder as they approached.
"Did I miss anything interesting?"
"No, folks are just getting settled into their tables. Dinner should be out soon."
"Shouldn't you be back there?"
Oli shook her head. 
"My sous chef is in charge of the food tonight. I wanted to spend time with old friends. Besides, she's been running the catering side for a little while now. Really taken to it fast--there's Annabelle!"
Oli pulled Tuck towards a table with a woman in an off the shoulder dress seated next to an empty chair with an expensive-looking black coat slung over the back.
"Tuck!" Annabelle said. She sprang from her seat and gave him a hug. 
"Good to see you, Annabelle. You look magnificent!"
Annabelle looked down at the dress and then surveyed the room frowning. 
"Adrien insisted we dress up like we were going to some gala. I told him we'd be over dressed, and I was right. I feel a little silly."
"You look great!" Oli said.
They all sat down around the red and white checkered table cloth.

# Context
Tucker, Adrien, Annabelle and Olivia (Oli) all went to the same high school in Kansas and were all in the same AV club, though due to funding it was more A than V. 

Adrien and Annabelle went on to an Ivy League school together and after some degrees and political jobs later, ended up with a successful magazine and podcast called '[[The Purple Couch]]' which fosters bi-partisan discussion. 

Tuck is a long haul trucker, drifting across the continent. He's late, and Oli is waiting for him. She's impatient but playful, indicating he's always been like this and is not likely to change. To give some indication of Tuck's love of the odd, original and authentic. Introduce that Oli is married to a woman (Kay?) and has kids. 

Tuck has a dog, Hank. Hank is a big droopy bloodhound-mastiff mix. He's pretty lazy in the truck, but loves a good sniff. 

# objectives
This scene is trying to establish setting and protagonist very quickly.
- we like Tuck and Hank
- we like Oli
- This is a high school Reunion
- Tuck is a little rough around the edges, but charming
- Oli is earnest and sweet
- Oli and Tuck are close, though they don't see each other often
- Oli is in charge of catering and is the only one of the friends who lives in the town
I think this scene accomplishes this pretty well
