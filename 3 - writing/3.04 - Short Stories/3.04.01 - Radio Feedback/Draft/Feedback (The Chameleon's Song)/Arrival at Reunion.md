# Context
Tucker, Adrien, Annabelle and Olivia (Oli) all went to the same high school in Kansas and were all in the same AV club, though due to funding it was more A than V. 

Adrien and Annabelle went on to an Ivy League school together and after some degrees and political jobs later, ended up with a successful magazine and podcast called '[[The Purple Couch]]' which fosters bi-partisan discussion. 

Tuck is a long haul trucker, drifting across the continent. He's late, and Oli is waiting for him. She's impatient but playful, indicating he's always been like this and is not likely to change. To give some indication of Tuck's love of the odd, original and authentic. Introduce that Oli is married to a woman (Kay?) and has kids. 

Tuck has a dog, Hank. Hank is a big droopy bloodhound-mastiff mix. He's pretty lazy in the truck, but loves a good sniff.
