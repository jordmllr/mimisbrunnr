- Truck Driver - encyclopedic knowledge of radio stations across the country. Wants to be close, but afraid of getting hurt. Maybe because of something in his past? Left at the alter? Maybe the person who hurt him will be at the reunion?

    - sleeps in a little bed in his cab with his dog.

    - usually drives at night: less traffic, weirder radio.

    - Motivation: the trucker is an observer. He is a coinnesseur of the absurd and the weird. Roadside attractions and the little hidden corners of the world that nobody knows about. He is motivated to push and prod people to reveal their more quirky, interesting bits. He is the shakespearean fool of the group. He is particularly unimpressed by the pretense of the radio couple. They used to both be so cool and interesting and weird. Now they just talk about all the same things that everyone else on the radio talks about. echoes echoes echoes. He is determined to bring their heads out of their asses. He's the most direct communicator.

        -  he hates that everywhere is gradually becoming homogenized. Everywhere you can get the same stuff. The same music. The same food. The same clothes. The same everything.

  

- The public intellectual couple - two of the club members ended up meeting much later in life. Maybe after a divorce? an affair? There is some underlying insecurity that the wife has about the husband.

    - maybe they are public intellectuals? They both travel and speak on radio and TV shows a lot. They are public critics, seeing themselves as offering a critical eye to current events. They have their own media platform now. She worries that he is more in love with their public persona than her.

    - have a podcast show and a website. It's a constant grind and hustle and bustle. The woman is tired. The man seems to thrive on it.

    - Across the aisle is a talk show where Mel and Adrian interview moderates and discuss current events from moderate but slightly left(Adrian) and right(Mel) of center. Mel is from Kansas and is sympathetic to rural America. Adrian is from Boston, and only lived in Kansas temporarily in high school. They have a lot of overlap in their views and tried to bring a moderating voice to American discourse.

    - Their new podcast--deep purple--is a deep dive into centrist politics. They interview politicians working together across the aisle to get things done. They make commentary on extremist left and right voices and provide political critique.  

  

- The small-time celebrity - someone who became a small-time celebrity. Jealous and intimidated by the success/status of the radio couple. People are proud, but they see themselves as a failure. They had such big ambitions and they feel like they let themselves down. Their perception of themselves is so much worse than everyone else's. This is an opportunity for the radio to play a CBT like role. They think everyone thinks of them as a failure, but there is direct evidence that they aren't.

  

- Local community developer/politician - someone who stayed local and is committed to making their town better for the people there. They understand why people leave, but there are beautiful things about their town. Everywhere is amazing if you look and work hard enough. Problems are the same all over the world. Their radio stories are in multiple languages and are generally positive and warm. This person is one of those infuriatingly optimistic people who see the good in everything.

    - Motivation: They want to make the world a better place. They are tired of the negativity and the cynicism. They went out to Washington and spent some time abroad, doing things with the UN. They realized that so many of the problems with the world come from abstraction. The devil is always in the details. Change is slow and small and hard. Dealing with real people is messy.

        - maybe the Trucker and the local developer are a couple too? Maybe just good friends? Maybe high-school sweethearts?

            - They and the trucker get coffee at the diner whenever the trucker passes through?

        - Their notes and radio stories are mixed. They feel a little discouraged, but the trucker helps put them right again.

  

- Mr. Eaves - the radio club teacher. Mr. Eaves passed away a few years before the reunion. Few (None?) of them were in touch with him and they feel guilty. They are staying in his house for the reunion.

    - explore theme of formative mentor who falls out of touch.

        - Maybe he sent a letter to one of them and they never replied?

    - They saw it on airbnb (put up by his sister? someone close to him? someone who sheds light on how lonely he was?)
