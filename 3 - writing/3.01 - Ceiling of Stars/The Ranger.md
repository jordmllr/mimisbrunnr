An old ranger on one of his last seasons is training a few new rangers. 

Opening vignette is to put the coyotes down for killing the cattle(they aren't at fault for being coyotes)

Some time passes with life as normal on the range. 

They start finding cattle mutilated and sacrificed. They radio on and are tasked with investigating and protecting the herd. Red joins them (from the Arc).

See 2 riders on the horizon. Red says he saw those same two riders in the other sector before all their cattle got killed. Says they likely ain't working alone though. Ranger says they'll go track them in the morning.

Leave and start tracking the 2 men. sign is obvious and Red demonstrates his tracking skills. 

They find their camp at night and listen to the conversation for a bit. Then they come out and confront the men. Ranger goes to arrest them, but then Red turns. 'Fraid I can't do that, Ranger' Ranger realizes Red's the mastermind. Red knocks ranger out. 

Ranger wakes up upside down hung from a tree. 

Red comes up and talks to him, delivers a soliloquy.

Cut down just before dawn, placed gently on the ground by Red.

Wakes up and rides back to the Arc. He'd go back, tell them what had happened, what red had said. They'd go looking for him, but they wouldn't find him.
