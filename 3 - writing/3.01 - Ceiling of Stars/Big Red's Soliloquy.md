You believe in fate, Ranger?

I believe we all have a purpose in this life. Some of us find it, others don't.

Purpose? Like a destiny?

Yeah, I suppose so. 

Oh, Ranger. Not destiny. Nothing so young and feeble as destiny. Fate. Fury. The chains--no ropes; the ropes stranded out of the chaos that bind us to this life. You must have felt it. All those nights out in an empty like this? You must have felt it. Those ropes tying you to everything you are and everything around you. No changin' it, no fighting it. The more you struggle, the tigheter they get. I tried and tried, tried til I couldn't breathe. But there's only one way to loose em. You have to let em be. Accept em, and let them pull you where they may.

You talk too much.

My daddy used to say the same. Jawin' he called it. 'Cept jawin means you ain't got something to say. I speak the Truth.

So you're the prophet. Are they your disciples? (gestures to Henry and Sam)

They are the donkey and the palm on my way to the kingdom. 

The Arc? if you want to go to the arc, why not just go? Why all this violence? You could have all gone and been accepted there, had good lives there. 

Red looked out to the peak that broke the horizon line. 

Mine is not a city under a hill. The kingdom is a city on the hill, back in the mountains of my birth.
(shivers). They're old moutnains with darkness in the undergrowth. We're not here for you, or them (nods to the Arc). We're just passing through.

Then why do all this?

So you will know that I have been here and that behind me comes the end. You are my messenger, Ranger. You tell them, and tell them to tell the others: the end is coming behind me and many souls will pass beyond the veil. Not mine, I have work to do here for some time, but yours and most of the rest will travel on into the land of light or shadow. In the morning, we'll be gone, you'll go back, and you'll tell them what I told you. You'll look for us, but you won't find us. Ain't got the eyes to see. Goodnight, Ranger.
