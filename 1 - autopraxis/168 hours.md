- There are 24\*7=**168 hours in a week**
- Assume 7\*8=56 hours for sleep, **112 hours remain**
- For most of us, 8\*5=40 hours for a job, **72 hours remain**
- Exercise, 2 hr/day including mobility, stretching etc. 14hr/wk, **58 hr remain**
- Socializing, 3 hr/day -> 21 hr/wk, **37 hr remain**
- Of 37 remaining hours, 3 hr/weekday and 11hr/weekend day

The question is how do I want to spend that time? Also, some of them time is inevitably eaten up by cooking, cleaning, and other errands or chores. 

On the weekend, I find myself socializing more, so maybe it bumps up to 6 hours per day on the weekend. That still leaves 8 hours per weekend day (31 hours per week).

Currently, I am almost 35 years old. There's a decent chance I'll live til beyond 70, but let's call that a conservative cap. If I have another 35 years, that is 1,820 weeks--which feels depressingly short. 1820wk\*31hr/wk = 56,420 hrs of productive non-professional work time. 

Of course, my impulse is to try to cram that time full of all my ambitions, but that way lies madness. Rather, it is helpful to realize the brevity of that time, but also the magnitude. 

Note: above, I make an assumption of 40hrs per week of work. However, this assumes meaningful work aligned with my priorities. I think that is what I have with my current role at New Classrooms, but it is worth calling out that if we don't bucket that 8hrs for professional work, we have a lot more time.
